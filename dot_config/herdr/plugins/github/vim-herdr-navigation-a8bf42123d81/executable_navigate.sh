#
# If the focused pane is running Vim/Neovim in the foreground, hand the matching
# Ctrl chord to that pane so Vim moves between its own splits (and, at a split
# edge, calls back into herdr to cross the pane boundary — see editor/*). For any
# other foreground process, move herdr's pane focus directly.
#
# Requires `jq`. Without it, detection is skipped and every key just moves the
# herdr pane focus (no Vim awareness).
